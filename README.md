# ACES
Attention Monitoring and Cognition Enhancement System (ACES) Learning Material and Performance Measurement Application

Built in Qt Creator 11.0.3 (Community), QT version 6.6.0

Currently there is only the Spot the Difference game with performance tracking. 
It has 10 images at the moment, and will continuously cycle through the same set of images indefinitely. Every image has 3 minutes to find all differences.

The event_log.csv file that is generated to measure user performance in the spot the difference game is overwritten each time the application is launched. 
Ensure that you separately save or rename that file before launching a new instance if you want to keep its data.
